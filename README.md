## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the application in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```


## Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the production server:

npm start
```


## Environment Variables

This project uses the DummyJSON API and stores authentication tokens in localStorage. No mandatory environment variables are required.

If you want to configure the API URL through environment variables, create a file named:

```text
.env.local
```

Add the following variable:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://dummyjson.com
```

You can then access it in the application using:

```javascript
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```


## Demo Credentials

```text
Username: emilys
Password: emilyspass
```
